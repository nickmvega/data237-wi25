# DATA 2x700 Readings
Here are the reading resoucres for the course separated by the topics we study each week. 
### Week 1
#### Value of data visualization
- [The Value of Visualization](https://vanwijk.win.tue.nl/vov.pdf)
- [The Eyes Have It](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/545307)

### Week 2: Fundamentals of chart construction and working with data
#### Grammar of graphics
- [A Layered Grammar of Graphics](https://byrneslab.net/classes/biol607/readings/wickham_layered-grammar.pdf)

#### Data models, Literate programming
- This [paper by Cleveland and McGill](http://euclid.psych.yorku.ca/www/psy6135/papers/ClevelandMcGill1984.pdf) set a precedent for treating visualization effectiveness as an empirical question. Many papers have followed up on this work, and the findings remain roughly intact.
- [Mackinlay's APT paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/22949.22950) lays out his expressiveness and effectiveness criteria for visualization design. This paper kicked off a long line of work on visualization recommender systems.
- Particularly interesting violations of the expressiveness principle (a.k.a. "tell the truth and nothing but the truth") occur when people's expectations about what a certain kind of chart will show are violated. Among other sources, these expectations are informed by graphical conventions, such as the expectations that people have about the semantics of bars and lines addressed in this [paper by Zacks and Tversky](https://dcl.wustl.edu/files/2017/09/zacksmemcog99-12d5ktx.pdf), which I mentioned in class.

### Week 3: Principles for visualization design
#### Design process and critique
- Tufte's [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](https://kyl.neocities.org/books/%5BTEC%20TUF%5D%20the%20visual%20display%20of%20quantitative%20information.pdf). Classes like this one often assign the first three chapters of this book as reading, probably because Tufte's work is rich with examples. However, Tufte sometimes asserts as design principles ideas that don't hold up when subjected to empirical scrutiny. His work is still viewed by the visualization community, with skepticism, as a wonderful resource.
- A few years ago, some of my colleagues at Northwestern decided there was too much visualization research for practitioners to keep up with. They led an effort to write this review article summarizing the [science of "what works"](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/reader/10.1177/15291006211051956) in data visualization design.
