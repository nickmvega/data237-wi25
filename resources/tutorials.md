# DATA 2x700 Tutorials
This is where we'll post links to tutorials, examples, and software tools separated by topic.

### Getting started with computational notebooks
- Welcome to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16pBJQePbqkz3QFV54L4NIkOn1kwpuRrj#scrollTo=u1wdmFKqylSI)
- Using [Google Colab with GitHub](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb)
- UChicago CS guide to [setting up VS Code](https://uchicago-cs.github.io/student-resource-guide/vscode/about.html). *If you want to use VS Code instead of Google Colab, the environment setup is your responsibility.*
- Although we do not use R much this quarter, it supports an excellent data science toolkit. You can check out [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) as an alternative IDE for R if you don't want to use VS Code or Colab.

### Programming tools
- Basic [pandas tutor](https://pandastutor.com/) demonstrating common dataframe operations
- [Intro to pandas](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/mlcc/intro_to_pandas.ipynb#scrollTo=JndnmDMp66FL) in Google Colab
- The primary visualization API we teach in this course is **Altair**. Check out their [user guide](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/data.html), [example gallery](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/index.html), [API](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/api.html), and more on the same website! 
- Altair is actually a wrapper around a JavaScript library called Vega-Lite. If you're interested, check out the [Vega-Lite example gallery](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/) to compare its syntax with that of Altair.
- [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/) and [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) are declarative grammars for interactive visualization that compile to [D3](https://d3js.org/) visualizations. Altair leverages this software stack by wrapping python syntax around Vega-Lite.
- From the creators of popular visualization toolkits like D3, Vega, and Vega-Lite, the University of Washington Interactive Data Lab has graciously made their [visualization curriculum](https://github.com/uwdata/visualization-curriculum) public! The notebooks posted here give an excellent walkthrough of some topics we'll cover in this course.
- The [PyMC](https://www.pymc.io/welcome.html) and [arviz](https://python.arviz.org/en/stable/examples/index.html) APIs for Bayesian statistics workflows in Python.
- Matthew Kay's [ggdist R package](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/) for visualizing distributions.
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) Python module for ML.
- Microsoft's open source Python module for ML interpretability, [interpret](https://github.com/interpretml/interpret/).

### Demos and videos
- Interactive [scatterplot matrix](https://vega.github.io/vega/examples/brushing-scatter-plots/)
- Hans Rosling's [visualization storytelling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVimVzgtD6w).
- Amanda Cox from the New York Times on [uncertainty visualizations in the news](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L1tGo-DvD0) (2:55 â€“ 10:43).
- Fred Hohman's presentations about his work on [ML interpretability](https://fredhohman.com/dissertation/).


### Choosing colors
- An overview of [color schemes](https://observablehq.com/@d3/color-schemes) available in Altair.
- The [ColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3) tool for choosing color palettes.

### Map projections
- An interactive gallery of [map projections](https://observablehq.com/@d3/projection-transitions) available in Altair.

### Data stories
- [Idyll](https://idyll-lang.org/gallery) language for interactive data stories.
- Check out more interactive articles on [Distill Pub](https://distill.pub/) and the [Parametric Press](https://parametric.press/issue-02/).
